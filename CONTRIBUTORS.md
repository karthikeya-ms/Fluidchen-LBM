# FLUIDCHEN contributors

This code framework has historically evolved from collective efforts of the
Chair of Scientific Computing in Computer Scinece at the Technical
University of Munich for the course IN2186 Computational Fluid
Dynamics Lab. It was first converted from C to C++ for the summer
semester 2020 and it was largely redesigned for the summer semester
2021. Major contributors to FLUIDCHEN include:

- Oguz Ziya Koseomur (TUM student assistant and CFDLab student 2020):
  redesign, based on the code "FLUIDCHEN" developed as student group
  work in the summer semester 2020.
- Carme Homs Pons (TUM CFDLab student 2020): contributions to the original FLUIDCHEN.
- Aristotelis Economides (TUM CFDLab student 2020): contributions to the original FLUIDCHEN.
- Moritz Gnisia (TUM student assistant and TUM CFDLab student 2019):
  conversion of the previous C implementation to C++ and further contributions.
- Benjamin Rodenberg (TUM employee): supervision of the code redesigning process, previous contributions.
- Gerasimos Chourdakis (TUM employee): supervision of the code redesigning process, previous contributions.
